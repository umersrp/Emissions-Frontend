            Scope 1 includes direct GHG emissions from owned and leased facilities under the operational control of the organisation (e.g. offices / warehouses). These are emissions resulting from the combustion of fuels, refrigerant leakage and the use of selected industrial and shielding gases. They occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc.; emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment.
